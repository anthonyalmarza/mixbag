## Overview

`PyProject Script` is a very simple development tool intended to be used with
`pyproject.toml` configuration files. The intention is to provide an interface
for running scripts within a local development workflow.

```toml
# in your pyproject.toml
[tool.pyscript]
tests = "path.to.my.tests.script:entrypoint_callable"
```

Running `pyscript tests` after installing `pyscript` will import the
`path.to.my.tests.script` module and will call `entrypoint_callable` callable.

### Why?

This library works in much the same way as `poetry`'s `poetry run` command,
without actually including those scripts in your project build.

What this means is that if you use `poetry`'s `[tools.poetry.scripts]`
configuration option then all scripts listed there will get bundled into your
project wheel and installed as a binary for execution when someone installs your
library.

So this library aims to provide an interface that is consistent with that of
`poetry` scripts, which coupling those scripts to your deployed wheel bundle.

> NOTE: This is an alpha release. Use it your own risk.
