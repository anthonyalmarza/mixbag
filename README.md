> A collection of open-source Python projects

This repo represents an attempt to streamline the development and delivery of a
number open-source python projects using a strict monorepo structure on top of
`poetry`.

## Overview

### Projects
Open source python projects - with the intention of making them available via
pypi

TBD


## Why?

Simple. I was neglecting and losing track of my side projects.
The older the projects became the harder they became to keep up to date.
More than that, I stopped pushing myself to try new things.

So I found myself constantly spinning up private GitHub repos to collect ideas.
Unsurprisingly these projects just fell by the wayside as life popped up and
"got in the way".

in a space where potentially reuse elsewhere ...
Manage interdependent packages


## Local Development

TBD
